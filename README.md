meta-ivi, the Yocto layer for In-Vehicle Infotainment
=====================================================

This layer's purpose is to add In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) support when
used with Poky.  The goal is to make the Yocto Project reference system
Poky GENIVI compliant.

Please see the
[MAINTAINERS](http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/meta-ivi/tree/MAINTAINERS)
file for information on contacting the maintainers
of this layer, as well as instructions for submitting patches.

The meta-ivi project welcomes contributions. You can contribute code,
submit patches, report bugs, answer questions on our mailing lists and
review and edit our documentation and much more.

Using the above git sha's and the master meta-ivi branch, bitbaking miranda-image
is known to work (the miranda-image build should be aligned with GENIVI 11.0).

For creating a specific GENIVI compliant image version, please make sure you
git checkout the related meta-ivi branch and follow the build instructions
located in the README.md file of that branch.  So for example, to build
an image that should be GENIVI 6.0 compliant, checkout the meta-ivi 6.0 branch,
and follow the README.md part of that branch.  As does the GENIVI Alliance
we only support the current and the previous version.  Any version older
than that is not supported any more, and therefore may not build or run.

Supported Machines
------------------

We do smoke test the builds of the three machines that we currently support:

* QEMU (ARMv7) - emulated machine: vexpressa9
* QEMU (IA-32) - emulated machine: qemux86
* QEMU (x86-64) - emulated machine: qemux86-64

Please check on our [wiki](http://wiki.projects.genivi.org/index.php/meta-ivi)
regarding any community supported machines.
For example there Renesas provides a public Board Support Package (BSP)
available for use with meta-ivi.

Build a QEMU image that contains GENIVI components
--------------------------------------------------

You can build a QEMU image that should be GENIVI compliant using the
following steps:

1. Export TEMPLATECONF to pick up correct configuration for the build
export TEMPLATECONF=/full/path/to/meta-ivi/meta-ivi/conf

2. Run the following command:
   > $ source poky/oe-init-build-env

3. Build s/w image including GENIVI 11.0 compliance components
   > $ bitbake miranda-image

4. Run the emulator:
   > for qemu vexpressa9:  
   > $ PATH_TO_META_IVI/meta-ivi/scripts/runqemu miranda-image vexpressa9
   >
   > for qemu x86:  
   > $ PATH_TO_META_IVI/meta-ivi/scripts/runqemu miranda-image qemux86
   >
   > for qemu x86-64:  
   > $ PATH_TO_META_IVI/meta-ivi/scripts/runqemu miranda-image qemux86-64

I completely understand the reasoning behind this. The point I'm trying to make is that the automotive industry has a strong need for reproducible offline builds and any kind of mandatory online checks break this requirement. And like Federico said, using SRCREV is also the Yocto project practice.

If we want meta-ivi to be widely used in the industry I believe it should support it's needs. In my opinion the same should go for the whole GENIVI stack to work nicely, which in particular means tags of the projects should not change. But the easiest solution would be for meta-ivi to not use tags. That way it supports offline builds and it is also possible to track bugfixes in the projects instead of pinning to the tag and then getting the bugfixes in patch by patch until next release.

How do the others on this list feel about this proposal?
